## 🔐💭 **Capture the Ether Challenge: Guess the Secret Number** 💭🔐

**A New Twist on the Trail**  
Continuing my journey through the Capture the Ether challenges, I encountered the "Guess the Secret Number" challenge. Unlike the first, this one added a layer of complexity with a hash matching quest.

**The Puzzle**  
The challenge? To discover an elusive number whose keccak256 hash matched a given hash in the smart contract—a true test of computational approach and Ethereum's hashing algorithm.

**The Strategy**  
Brute force was the name of the game. Using a for loop, I churned through possibilities, hashing each one using Ethers.js until a match was found. With only 256 possibilities (thanks to the `uint8` data type), it was a task well-suited for a script.

**Triumph Secured**  
And there it was, the secret number revealed itself, and with another transaction of 1 ether, victory was claimed!

**Insights Gleaned**  
This exercise was a stark reminder of the power of hash functions in smart contract security and the importance of not relying on obscurity for security—after all, even a "secret" number can be unveiled.
