# Puzzle 9 Solution Explained

To solve this puzzle, we need to understand what the opcodes are doing and ensure we satisfy the conditions to avoid any `REVERT` instructions.

## Given Bytecode:

```
00 36 CALLDATASIZE
01 6003 PUSH1 03
03 10 LT
04 6009 PUSH1 09
06 57 JUMPI
07 FD REVERT
08 FD REVERT
09 5B JUMPDEST
0A 34 CALLVALUE
0B 36 CALLDATASIZE
0C 02 MUL
0D 6008 PUSH1 08
0F 14 EQ
10 6014 PUSH1 14
12 57 JUMPI
13 FD REVERT
14 5B JUMPDEST
15 00 STOP
```

## Explanation:

1. `CALLDATASIZE` needs to be greater than or equal to 3 bytes to pass the first check (avoiding the jump at 06).

2. `CALLVALUE` multiplied by `CALLDATASIZE` must equal `08`. To satisfy this condition, `CALLDATASIZE` should be `4` (since `0x00000000` is 4 bytes) and `CALLVALUE` should be `2` because `2 * 4 = 8`.

## Solution:

With these points in mind, the call value is set to `2`, and the call data is a 4-byte string of zeros:

```json
{ "data": "0x00000000", "value": 2 }
```
